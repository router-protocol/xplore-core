# Router Aggregator Core

A TypeScript SDK for router aggregation with comprehensive support for cross-chain bridges and decentralized exchange aggregators.

## Overview

Router Aggregator Core provides a unified interface for interacting with multiple routing protocols, categorizing them into two distinct types:

- **Bridges**: Cross-chain protocols that facilitate token transfers between different blockchains
- **Exchanges**: DEX aggregators that find optimal trading routes within and across chains

## Key Features

- **Type-Safe Node Classification**: Clear distinction between bridge and exchange nodes with TypeScript support
- **Comprehensive Protocol Support**: Support for 9+ major protocols including Relay, deBridge, Across, OpenOcean, and more
- **Chain Compatibility**: Built-in compatibility mappings for different blockchain types
- **Utility Functions**: Rich set of helper functions for node categorization and filtering
- **Modern TypeScript**: Built with strict TypeScript and modern tooling

## Quick Example

```typescript
import { BridgeNodes, ExchangeNodes, isBridgeNode, isExchangeNode } from '@routerprotocol/xplore-core'

// Type-safe node classification
const relay = BridgeNodes.RELAY
const openocean = ExchangeNodes.OPENOCEAN

// Runtime type checking
console.log(isBridgeNode(relay))     // true
console.log(isExchangeNode(relay))   // false
console.log(isExchangeNode(openocean)) // true
```

## Supported Protocols

### Bridges
- **Relay**: Multi-chain bridge supporting EVM, Solana, Sui, and Bitcoin
- **deBridge**: Cross-chain liquidity protocol
- **Across**: Optimistic cross-chain bridge
- **THORChain**: Native cross-chain liquidity protocol supporting Bitcoin
- **Stargate Taxi**: Cross-chain bridge using LayerZero
- **Mayan CCTP**: Protocol using Circle's Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol
- **Mayan Swift**: Fast bridging solution from Mayan
- **GasZip**: Native token bridge for gas fee optimization

### Exchanges
- **OpenOcean**: DEX aggregator with cross-chain capabilities
